How to setup Sprockets without Rails. Self referencial association with DataMapper. Delayed job for Sinatra.


Overview
--------


In the [previous post](/2012/05/19/Chatting-on-twitter-with-pusher.html "previous post"), we have seen how to embed a chat widget with Coffescript.
We mainly covered javascript events sent from the server to the clients using
[pusher](http://www.pusher.com "pusher"). In this post we will see how to setup
Sprockets without Rails,  we'll cover self referential associations for friendship
relations, and finally we'll setup Delayed Job with Sinatra to fetch user's friends
in background.

Sprockets without Rails
-----------------------

Sprockets is a utility to compile coffescript/javascript and stylesheets. It's very useful when we write
lots of javascript and we need a way to package all the files in a single _application.js_. It also
supports _ECO_ templates and automatically creates a global variable to store our javascript templates.

Blatantly taken from [sprockets without rails](http://www.simonecarletti.com/blog/2011/09/using-sprockets-without-a-railsrack-project/ "sprockets without rails")
courtesy of [Simone Carletti](http://www.simonecarletti.com/ "Simone Carletti"), there is an effective
way to setup Sprockets without Rails. The following code goes in a **Rakefile.rb**.


{% highlight ruby %}
      require 'rubygems'
      require 'bundler'
      require 'pathname'
      require 'logger'
      require 'fileutils'
      require 'data_mapper'

      Bundler.require

      ROOT        = Pathname(File.dirname(__FILE__))
      LOGGER      = Logger.new(STDOUT)
      BUNDLES     = %w( application.css application.js )
      BUILD_DIR   = ROOT.join("public")
      SOURCE_DIR  = ROOT.join("assets")



      task :compile do
        sprockets = Sprockets::Environment.new(ROOT) do |env|
          env.logger = LOGGER
        end

        sprockets.append_path(SOURCE_DIR.join('javascripts').to_s)
        sprockets.append_path(SOURCE_DIR.join('templates').to_s)
        sprockets.append_path(SOURCE_DIR.join('stylesheets').to_s)

        BUNDLES.each do |bundle|
          assets = sprockets.find_asset(bundle)
          prefix, basename = assets.pathname.to_s.split('/')[-2..-1]
          FileUtils.mkpath BUILD_DIR.join(prefix)

          assets.to_a.each do |asset|
            # strip filename.css.foo.bar.css multiple extensions
            realname = asset.pathname.basename.to_s.split(".")[0..1].join(".")
            asset.write_to(BUILD_DIR.join(prefix, realname))
          end

          assets.write_to(BUILD_DIR.join(prefix, basename))
        end
      end
{% endhighlight %}


It is also useful to automatically save and compile javascript files without manually running rake tasks.
To do so, we setup a **watchr** file, and install the gem [watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr "watchr").

{% highlight ruby %}
      def run_sprockets
        print "\nCompiling... "
        system('rake compile')
        print "done.\n"
      end

      Signal.trap('INT') { abort("\n") }
      watch( 'assets/javascripts/*') { run_sprockets}
      watch( 'assets/templates/*') { run_sprockets}
{% endhighlight %}


Relationship status: It's not complicated
-----------------------------------------

We use [Datamapper](http://datamapper.org/ "Datamapper") for out database models. It's easy to use and
we don't have to worry about migrations (and that's ok given this simplicity of this project). Documentation
is really good, we reuse part of _Self referential many to many relationships_ section in
[Associations](http://datamapper.org/docs/associations.html "Associations")
and we add few utility methods.

{% highlight ruby %}
      class User
        include DataMapper::Resource

        property :id,         Serial
        property :name,       String
        property :uid,        String, :required => true
        property :nickname,   String
        property :created_at, DateTime
        property :online,     Boolean, :default  => false

        has n, :friendships, :child_key => [ :source_id ]
        has n, :friends, self, :through => :friendships, :via => :target

        has n, :inverse_friendships, 'Friendship', :child_key =>[:target_id]
        has n, :inverse_friends, self, :through =>:inverse_friendships, :via =>:source
        def online!
          self.online = true
          self.save
        end

        def friend?(friend)
          friends.first(:id =>friend.id) or inverse_friends.first(:id=>friend.id)
        end

        def offline!
          self.online = false
          self.save
        end

        def online_friends
          fs = friends.all(:online=>true)
          ls = inverse_friends.all(:online=>true)
          fs + ls
        end

      end

      class Friendship
        include DataMapper::Resource
        belongs_to :source, 'User', :key => true
        belongs_to :target, 'User', :key => true
      end
{% endhighlight %}

We have added **online** and **offline** methods, a method to get online friends and
the _inverse\_friendship_ relation. If user _A_ is friend with user _B_, then it means _B_ is also
friend with _A_. We store this relation only once in the **Friendship** table and use the inverse
friendship relation.



Omniauth Twitter strategy using Sinatra
----------------------------------

[Omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth "Omniauth") makes it very easy to authenticate with Twitter.
We just need to provide a callback method, and store the user informations.

{% highlight ruby %}
      get '/auth/twitter/callback' do

        auth = request.env["omniauth.auth"]
        user = User.first_or_create({ :uid => auth["uid"]}, {
          :uid => auth["uid"],
          :nickname => auth["info"]["nickname"],
          :name => auth["info"]["name"],
          :created_at => Time.now
        })

        if user.nickname.nil? or user.nickname.empty?
          user.nickname = auth["info"]["nickname"]
          user.save
        end

        if user and user.nickname and user.friends.empty?
          job = LookupFriends.new(user.nickname)
          Delayed::Job.enqueue job
        end
        session[:user_id] = user.id
        redirect 'https://twitter.com'
      end
{% endhighlight %}


Sinatra and Delayed Job
-----------------------

In the previous code snippet we use _Delayed Job_ to fetch our friends. We need to setup
[delayed job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job "delayed job")
with Sinatra and define a couple of _tasks_ to start and clear the job queue in our _Rakefile.rb_.
Note that the following  tasks are useful when we deploy the code to [heroku](http://www.heroku.com "heroku").

{% highlight ruby %}
      task :environment do
        require 'delayed_job'
        require 'delayed_job_data_mapper'
        require './models'
        require './job'
        DataMapper.setup(:default, ENV['DATABASE_URL'] || "sqlite3://#{Dir.pwd}/db.sqlite3")
        DataMapper.finalize
      end


      namespace :jobs do
        desc "Clear the delayed_job queue."
        task :clear => :environment do
          Delayed::Job.delete_all
        end

        desc "Start a delayed_job worker."
        task :work => :environment do
          Delayed::Worker.new(
            :min_priority => ENV['MIN_PRIORITY'],
            :max_priority => ENV['MAX_PRIORITY']).start
        end
      end
{% endhighlight %}


Delayed Job is now ready. We need to setup the actual _worker_:

{% highlight ruby %}
      class LookupFriends < Struct.new(:nickname)

        def perform
          friends = Twitter.friend_ids(nickname.to_s)
          user = User.first(:nickname => nickname)
          if friends.ids
            friends.ids.each do |id|
              friend = User.first_or_create(:uid=> id)
              user.friends << friend unless user.friends.first(:uid=> id)
            end
            user.save
          end
        end
      end
{% endhighlight %}


Conclusions
-----------

In the previous post we've seen how to embed a chat widget inside a Twitter page,
using pusher and CORS requests.

Behind the scenes though there are few tricks to talk about. The widgets is a coffescript _single page_
mini application. Sprockets is an important tool to glue Coffescript files together. The database used
is  necessary to check for online or offline users. Finally, we've seen how to setup Delayed Job to
fetch data in background, and populate the database with _friends_ data.
